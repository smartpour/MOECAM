is fundamental when applying indicator-based algorithms in practice. On the one hand, a
characterization of the inherent optimization goal of different indicators allows the user
to choose the indicator that meets her preferences. On the other hand, knowledge about

One of the most popular indicators is the weighted hypervolume indicator. It allows
to guide the search towards user-defined objective space regions and at the same time
has the property of being a refinement of the Pareto dominance relation with the
result that maximizing the indicator results in Pareto-optimal solutions only. In previous
work, we theoretically investigated the unweighted hypervolume indicator in terms of
a characterization of optimal µ-distributions and the influence of the hypervolume’s

1. Introduction
Multiobjective optimization aims at optimizing several criteria simultaneously. In the last decades, evolutionary
algorithms have been shown to be well-suited for those problems in practice [13,11]. A recent trend is to use quality
indicatorstoturnamultiobjectiveoptimizationproblemintoasingle-objectiveonebyoptimizingthequalityindicatoritself.

aim at finding a set of solutions that maximizes the underlying quality indicator and a fundamental question is whether
these two optimization goals coincide or how they differ. In practice, the population size of indicator-based algorithms is
usually finite, i.e., equal to µ ∈ N, and the optimization goal changes to finding a set of µ solutions optimizing the quality
indicator.1 We call such a set an optimal µ -distribution for the given indicator generalizing the definition given by Auger
µ
et al. [2]. In this case, the additional questions arise how the number of points influences the optimization goal and to

search bias. This has for instance been shown experimentally by Friedrich et al. [19] for the multiplicative -indicator and
the hypervolume indicator.
Thehypervolumeindicatoranditsweightedversion[33]areparticularlyinterestingindicatorssincetheyarerefinements
of the Pareto dominance relation [37].2 Thus, an optimal µ -distribution for these indicators contains only Pareto-optimal
solutionsandtheset(probablyunboundedinsize)thatmaximizesthe(weighted)hypervolumeindicatorcoverstheentire
Pareto front [18]. Many other quality indicators do not have this fundamental property. It explains the success of the
hypervolume indicator as quality indicator applied to environmental selection of indicator-based evolutionary algorithms
such as ESP [22], SMS-EMOA [5], MO-CMA-ES [24], or HypE [3]. Nevertheless, it has been argued that using the (weighted)
hypervolume indicator to guide the search introduces a certain bias. Interestingly, several contradicting beliefs about this
biashavebeenreportedintheliteraturewhichwewilldiscusslateroninmoredetail(seeSection3).Theyrangefromstating

both the unweighted and the weighted hypervolume indicator depend on. The influence of this reference point on optimal

-distributionshasnotbeenfullyunderstood,especiallyfortheweightedhypervolumeindicator,andonlyrules-of-thumb
exist on how to choose the reference point in practice. In particular, it could not be observed from practical investigations
how the reference point has to be set to ensure to find the extremes of the Pareto front. Several authors recommend to use
the corner of a space that is a little bit larger than the actual objective space as the reference point [26,5]. For performance
assessment, others recommend to use the estimated nadir point as the reference point [32,31,23]. Also here, theoretical
investigations are highly needed to assist in practical applications.
µ
First theoretical studies on optimal -distributions for the (unweighted) hypervolume indicator and the choice of its
reference point have been published in an earlier work by the authors [2]. The theoretical analyses resulted in a better
understanding of the search bias the hypervolume indicator introduces and in theoretically founded recommendations on
wheretoplacethereferencepointinthecaseoftwoobjectives.Inparticular,somebeliefsabouttheindicator’ssearchbias
µ
could be disproved and others confirmed, the optimal -distributions for linear Pareto fronts were characterized exactly
(see also [10]), and lower bounds on the reference point’s objective values that allow to include the extremes of the Pareto
front in certain cases have been given. Recently, a specific result of Auger et al. [2] has been already generalized to the
weighted hypervolume indicator [1] and another exact result for specific Pareto fronts have been provided [19].
In this paper, we extend all results by Auger et al. [2] to the weighted case and provide a general theory of the
weighted hypervolume indicator in terms of both the inherently introduced search bias and the choice of the reference
point.
• Inparticular,wecharacterizethesetsof µ pointsthatmaximizethe(weighted)hypervolumeindicator;besidesgeneral

results for the weighted hypervolume indicator comply with the results for the unweighted case [2].
• Furthermore,weinvestigatetheinfluenceofthereferencepointonoptimal µ -distributions,i.e.,wederivelowerbounds

generalize the work by Auger et al. [2] to the weighted hypervolume indicator.

• In addition, we prove, in case the extremes can be obtained, that for any reference point dominated by the nadir point
µ
– with any small but positive distance between the two points – there is a finite number of points (possibly large in

practice) such that for all , the extremes are included in optimal -distributions.

• Last, we apply the theoretical results to linear Pareto fronts [2,10] and to benchmark problems of the ZDT [34], DTLZ
[15], and WFG [21] test problem suites resulting in recommended choices of the reference point including numerical
and sometimes analytical expressions for the resulting density of points on the front.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we recapitulate the basics of the (weighted) hypervolume indicator and introduce
the notations and definitions needed in the remainder of the paper (Section 2). Then, we consider the bias of the weighted
µ µ
hypervolumeindicatorintermsofoptimal -distributions.Aftercharacterizingoptimal -distributionsforafinitenumber
of solutions (Section 3.1), we derive results on the density of points if the number of points goes to infinity (Section 3.2).

Section 4 investigates the influence of the reference point on optimal -distributions especially on the extremes. The
application of the results to test problems is presented in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. The hypervolume indicator: general aspects and notations
Throughout this study we consider, without loss of generality, minimization problems where k objective functions
F : X → Z, 1 ≤ i ≤ k have to be minimized simultaneously. The vector function F := (F ,...,F ) thereby maps
i 1 k
each solution x in the decision space X to its corresponding objective vector F ( x ) in the objective space F ( X ) = Z ⊆ Rk.
Furthermore,weassumethattheunderlyingdominancestructureisgivenbytheweakParetodominancerelation≼which
isdefinedbetweenarbitrarysolutionpairs.Wesayx ∈ X weaklydominatesy ∈ X ifforall1 ≤ i ≤ k,F ( x ) ≤ F ( y ) andwrite
i i
x ≼ y. This weak Pareto dominance relation is generalized to sets of solutions in the following straightforward manner: we
say a set A of solutions weakly dominates another solution set B if for all b ∈ B there exists an a ∈ A such that a ≼ b. The
Pareto(-optimal)set P consistsofallsolutionsx ∗ ∈ X,suchthatthereisnox ∈ X thatsatisfiesx ≼ x ∗ andx ∗ ̸≼ x.Theimage

In the following, in order to simplify notations,3 we define the indicators for sets of objective vectors A ⊆ Rk instead for
solutionsetsA ′ ⊆ X asitwasalreadydonebefore[33,2].TheweightedhypervolumeindicatorI H,w ( A , r ) forasetofobjective
vectors A ⊆ Z is then the weighted Lebesgue measure of the set of objective vectors weakly dominated by the solutions in
