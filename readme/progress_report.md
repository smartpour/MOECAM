## 2. Research Foundation

The MOECAM project is built upon a solid foundation of multi-objective optimization research. Key papers and concepts that guided the development include:

- **"A Survey on Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms" by Zhou et al. (2011)**: This paper provided a comprehensive overview of MOEAs, informing the selection and implementation of NSGA-II and MOEA/D.
- **"A Large-Scale Experimental Evaluation of High-performing Multi- and Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithms" by Bezerra et al. (2018)**: This research influenced the design of our benchmarking and validation processes.
- **"Performance metrics in multi-objective optimization"**: This paper was crucial for understanding and implementing appropriate performance indicators like hypervolume.
- **"Purshouse-PhD-Dissertation-2003"**: Provided insights into specific aspects of multi-objective optimization.
- **ZDT and DTLZ Test Suites**: These standard test problems, as described in various academic sources, were implemented to ensure the algorithms' performance could be rigorously evaluated.
- **WFG Test Suite**: The framework for WFG functions was included to allow for testing with more complex and scalable problems.

Our C++ integration via CFFI was inspired by the need for high-performance numerical computation often found in advanced optimization research.




## 3. Results Summary

This week, we successfully implemented and tested the core components of MOECAM. The NSGA-II and MOEA/D algorithms were able to find good approximations of the Pareto fronts for the ZDT and DTLZ test problems. The performance metrics, including Pareto front extraction and hypervolume calculation, are functioning correctly. The C++ integration was verified, demonstrating the ability to call C++ functions from Python.

Key results include:

- **Successful Implementation**: All planned features for the core MOECAM package have been implemented and integrated.
- **Test Pass Rate**: All unit tests passed, indicating the robustness and correctness of the implemented modules.
- **Performance**: Initial tests show promising performance for NSGA-II and MOEA/D on standard benchmarks.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples are available for users.

## 4. Next Week's Plans

Next week, we plan to focus on:

- **Further Benchmarking**: Conduct more extensive benchmarking on a wider range of test problems, including the full WFG suite.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Explore and implement more advanced MOEAs or variations of existing ones.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Investigate optimal parameter settings for the implemented algorithms.
- **Scalability Analysis**: Analyze the performance of the algorithms on higher-dimensional problems.
- **User Interface Enhancement**: Improve the user interface for easier interaction and result analysis.
